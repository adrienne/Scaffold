# Scaffold Theme for the ExpressionEngine 2.0 Forum Module

### Overview

Not ready for prime time yet, it's work in progress.

I've worked very quickly, rewriting view files with the intent of giving devs as much control via css as possible. Tables have been removed where possible, many remain.

I'm still working through a few remaining view files, with some key tasks outstanding.

 - CSS needs a big tidy up
 - Many js functions need rewritten.

### Installation

Rename the download to `scaffold`, drop it into `/themes/forum_themes/` and activate via the cp.

First thing you'll want to do is update the header files and sort out your paths, and customise the menu etc.
You can find them in `/forum_global/`, `html_header.html` and `top_bar.html` are the files you're after.

### Begging / License / Disclaimer

If you find my work useful for your project, there's a nice green Pledgie donation button at the top of the page which could do with some love... You'd make this person in New Zealand quite happy, you would.
