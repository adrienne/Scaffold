# Scaffold Theme for the ExpressionEngine 2.0 Forum Module

### Overview

Not ready for prime time yet, it's work in progress.

I've worked very quickly, rewriting view files with the intent of giving devs as much control via css as possible. Tables have been removed where possible, many remain.

I'm still working through a few remaining view files, with some key tasks outstanding.

 - CSS needs a big tidy up
 - Many js functions need rewritten.

### Installation

Rename the download to `scaffold`, drop it into /themes/forum_themes/ and activate via the cp.
